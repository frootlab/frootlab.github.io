## About

*Nemoa* is a machine learning- and data analysis framework, that implements the
[Cloud-Assisted Meta Programming (CAMP)](/tags#CAMP) paradigm.

The key goal of Nemoa is to provide a long-term data analysis framework, which
seemingly integrates into existing enterprise data environments and thereby
supports collaborative data science. To achieve this goal Nemoa orchestrates
established Python frameworks like [TensorFlowÂ®](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
and [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and dynamically extends their
capabilities by community driven algorithms (e.g. for [probabilistic graphical
modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model), [machine
learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and [structured
data-analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_data_analysis_(statistics))).

According to our [convictions](/corporate/2019/03/19/welcome-at-frootlab.html),
Nemoa is [free and open
source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) software,
based on the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and actively
developed as part of our [Liquid ML](https://github.com/orgs/frootlab/projects)
framework. For more information please visit
[GitHub](https://github.com/frootlab/nemoa).
