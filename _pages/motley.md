# About

*Motley* is a planed repository server for algorithm storage and evaluation and
based on [GIT](https://git-scm.com/). Motley aims to serve as an algorithm
repository to allow the usage of [Currently Best Fitting (CBF)](/tags#CBF)
algorithms, as required by the [Cloud-Assisted Meta Programming
(CAMP)](/tags#CAMP) paradigm.

Due to this approach Motley interconnects enterprises and scientific workgroups:
On the one side it allows the implementation of enterprise analytical
applications, that are automatically kept up-to-date and therefore only require
a minimum of maintenance. On the other side, Motley supports scientific
workgroups, by facilitating the publication, application, evaluation and even
deployment of algorithms.

According to our [convictions](/corporate/2019/03/19/welcome-at-frootlab.html),
Motley is [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) & [open
source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software), based on the
[Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and actively developed as
part of our [Liquid Coding](https://github.com/orgs/frootlab/projects)
framework. For more information please visit
