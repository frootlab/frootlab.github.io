### About
**Nemoa** is a machine learning- and data analysis framework, that utilizes
cloud assisted metaprogramming for automated code optimization. Nemoa is based
on the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and actively
developed as part of the [Liquid ML](https://github.com/orgs/frootlab/projects)
framework.

The key goal of nemoa is to provide a long-term data analysis framework, which
seemingly integrates into existing enterprise data environments and thereby
supports collaborative data science. To achieve this goal nemoa orchestrates
established Python frameworks like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
and [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and dynamically extends their
capabilities by community driven algorithms (e.g. for [probabilistic graphical
modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model), [machine
learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and [structured
data-analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_data_analysis_(statistics))).
