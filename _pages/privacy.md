This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service of Google LLC
(hereinafter: ‘Google’):

your computer and allow an analysis of your use of the website. The information
generated by the cookie about your use of this website is typically transmitted
to a Google server in the U.S. and stored there.

Due to the activation of IP anonymization on these websites, your IP address
will be truncated beforehand by Google within the member states of the European
Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic
Area. This guarantees anonymized data collection by masking the last part of
your IP address. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a
Google server in the U.S. and truncated there. On behalf of the operator of this
website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website,
summarize reports on website activities and provide other services related to
website and Internet usage to the website operator. The IP address transferred
from your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be combined with other
data from Google.

The data processing purposes are the website-use analysis and the summary of
reports on activities on the website. Based on the use of the website and the
Internet, other related services will be provided.

#### Legal basis
The processing of the data occurs on the basis of the user’s consent according
to [Art. 6 §1 (a) GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/).

recording-keeping purposes.

#### Mandatory or required provision
The provision of your personal data is voluntary, based solely on your consent.
If you prevent access, this can lead to functional limitations on the website.

#### Revocation of consent
You can prevent the storage of cookies by a corresponding setting in your
browser software; however, please note that in this case you may not be able to
use all the functions of this website in their entirety. Furthermore, you can
prevent the collected data generated by the cookie and the data related to your
use of the website (including your IP address) being transmitted to Google, as
well as the processing of this data by Google, by downloading and installing the
browser plug-in available at the following link: [browser add-on to deactivate
Google Analytics](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB).

In addition, or as an alternative to the browser add-on, you can prevent
tracking by Google Analytics on our web pages [by clicking this link](# "Google
Analytics Opt-Out-Cookie setzen"), which will install an opt-out cookie on your
device. This will prevent data collection by Google Analytics for this website
and for this browser in the future, as long as the cookie remains installed in

#### Legal basis

associated data transfer to Google according to [Art. 6 §1 (a)
GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/).

Google, will collect data.

a default font will be used by your computer. If your supports web fonts, it
loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts
correctly, when you call up a page. To do this, the browser connects to the
Fonticons, Inc. servers. This will give Fonticons, Inc. notice, that our website
has been accessed through your IP address. For more information about Font
Awesome, see https://fontawesome.com/help.

#### Legal basis
The use of web fonts is in the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation
of our online offers. This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning
of [Art. 6 §1 (f) GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/).

#### Recipients

connection to the operator of the library. It is theoretically possible – but
