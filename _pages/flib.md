# About

The *Frootlab Shared Library* (flib) is a multi-purpose
[Python](https://www.python.org) library, which primarily aims to support [our
projects](https://www.frootlab.org) as a common shared library. It was
originally created in 2019 for the [Liquid
Coding](https://github.com/orgs/frootlab/projects) framework. The majority of
the provided modules, however, are kept generic to facilitate their application
beyond our organizational projects as well.

The Frootlab Shared Library is [open source](https://github.com/frootlab/flib),
based on the Python programming language and actively developed as part of the
[Liquid Coding](https://github.com/orgs/frootlab/projects) framework at
[Frootlab](https://www.frootlab.org). More information is provided at
[GitHub](https://github.com/frootlab/pandora).
