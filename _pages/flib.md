# About

The *Frootlab Shared Library* (flib) is a multi-purpose
[Python](https://www.python.org) library, which primarily aims to support [our
projects](https://www.frootlab.org) as a common shared library. It was
originally created in 2019 for the [Liquid
Coding](https://github.com/orgs/frootlab/projects) framework. The majority of
the provided modules, however, are kept generic to facilitate their application
beyond our organizational projects as well.

According to our [convictions](/corporate/2019/03/19/welcome-at-frootlab.html),
the Frootlab Shared Library is
[free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) & [open
source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software), based on the Python
programming language and actively developed as part of our [Liquid
Coding](https://github.com/orgs/frootlab/projects) framework. For more
information please visit [GitHub](https://github.com/frootlab/flib).
