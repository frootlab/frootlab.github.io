# About

*Pandora* is a universal database proxy and SQL-Database engine, that implements
high-performance and security requirements for large-scale enterprise analytical
applications.

The primary goal of Pandora is to separate data integration and data analysis
into independent tasks, by providing a unified data interface for machine
learning- and data analysis applications. To achieve this goal, Pandora
implements the two fundamental layers of a data warehouse.

According to our [convictions](/corporate/2019/03/19/welcome-at-frootlab.html),
Pandora is [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) & [open

part of our [Liquid Coding](https://github.com/orgs/frootlab/projects)
framework. For more information please visit
