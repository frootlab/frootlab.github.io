# About

*Pandora* is a universal database proxy and SQL-Database engine, that implements
high-performance and security requirements for large-scale enterprise analytical
applications.

The primary goal of Pandora is to separate data integration and data analysis
into independent tasks, by providing a unified data interface for machine
learning- and data analysis applications. To achieve this goal, Pandora
implements the two fundamental layers of a data warehouse.

Pandora is [open source](https://github.com/frootlab/pandora), based on the
[Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and actively developed as
part of the [Liquid Coding](https://github.com/orgs/frootlab/projects) framework
at [Frootlab](https://www.frootlab.org). More information is provided at
[GitHub](https://github.com/frootlab/pandora).
