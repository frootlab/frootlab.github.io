## About

**The AI-Revolution provides new challenges for developers in the data analysis
segment. This concerns enterprises, scientific workgroups and government
agencies as well, as it becomes increasingly demanding to adapt new technologies
into existing applications and therefore to stay competitive.**

We are a young developers team with strong expertise in data science and
networking technologies, which has been formed in mid 2018. Our mission is to
step into this breach by providing a revolutionary collaborative AutoML
framework, which allows smart applications, that keep themselves up-to-date and
adept new technologies.

Therefore we [identified the foremost challenges]({% post_url
2019-03-20-three-obstacles-in-data-science %}) and started to develop a
comprehensive solution, which on the basis of
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) incorporates machine intelligence and
collaborative data science into the whole software life cycle. The key
components of the framework comprise a [high performance database
proxy](/pandora.html), which supports a wide variety of different data sources,
[an auto-evaluating algorithm repository](/motley.html) and an [AutoML
templating system](/nemoa.html), which uses the other components to abstract
explicit algorithms to currently best fitting.

Our fundamental conviction is, that research and education should be provided
with universal access. Accordingly we release all components of this framework
as [free and open-source
software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software). Since
the application in industrial environments, however, requires stable development
and compliance with industrial standards, we release them as a single vendor,
rather then community-driven.
