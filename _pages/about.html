  <p><b>The prospects about the AI-Revolution can be overwhelming - but although
  the tension is palpable, the accompanied challenges are as well!</b></p>

  <p>This concerns enterprises, scientific workgroups and government agencies,
  as it becomes increasingly demanding to keep pace with the accelerating
  development and to stay competitive. We want to step into this breach by
  providing new technologies for the next generation of data science
  applications.</p>

  <p>We are a young developers team, which has been formed in mid-2018 in
  Heidelberg, Germany. Our fundamental conviction is, that research and
  education should be provided with universal access. Accordingly we release our
  projects as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">free
  software</a>. In order to provide stable development, we keep the sovereignty
  about the code as a single vendor.</p>

  <p>In order to realize our vision, we started with identifying the foremost
  <a href="{% post_url 2019-03-20-three-obstacles-in-data-science %}">
  obstacles</a> for collaborations in data science. Thereupon we initiated the
  planning and development of a comprehensive solution, that essentially shapes
  our mission: The <a href="/liquid">Liquid Code</a> framework.</p>

  <p>The Liquid Code framework is a software framework for data analysis
  applications, that incorporates machine intelligence and collaborative data
  science into the whole software life cycle. The key components are constituted
  be three subprojects, that implement a strictly separation of data sources,
  algorithms and program flow. These components are respectively given by <a

  title="Motley">Motley</a> and <a href="/nemoa" title="Nemoa">Nemoa</a> and
  share a common code base, given by the <a href="/flib" title="frootlab shared
  library">frootlab shared library</a>.</p>
