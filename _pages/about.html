  <p>The prospects about the AI-Revolution can be overwhelming - but although
  the tension is palpable, the accompanied challenges are as well!</p>

  <p>From an individual perspective this concerns enterprises, scientific
  workgroups and government agencies, as it becomes increasingly demanding to
  keep pace with the accelerated development and to stay competitive. On a
  larger scale, the global concentration of data science expertise poses
  the challenge of counteracting new geo-political and economic dependency
  structures that imperil freedoms and sovereignty.</p>

  <p><b>Our vision is a democratic and federated AI-Revolution, that does not
  lead to exclusion or incapacitation, but promotes public well-being, social
  justice and social cohesion.</b></p>

  <p>For us communication and cooperation are the key factors and driving force
  behind scientific and industrial progress. Consequently we undestand our
  Mission in the task to best possibly support collaborations in data science.
  </p>

  <p>We started with identifying the foremost
  <a href="{% post_url 2019-03-20-three-obstacles-in-data-science %}"
    title="Three obstacles in data science and one vision">
    obstacles for collaborations in data science</a>.
  These considerations led to the foundations of a pioneering software
  framework, that shapes our mission: The <a href="/liquid">Liquid Code</a>
  framework.</p>

  {% include article/figure.html url="/images/fig/liquid-collaboration.svg"
    description="Collaboration between researchers (green) and developers
    (blue) using the Liquid Code framework" %}

  <p>The Liquid Code framework is a software framework for machine learning and
  data analysis applications, that interconnects collaborative data science with
  automated machine learning. Thereby it strictly seperates data sources and
  algorithms from the program flow, which provides some significant advantages:
  The program flow and the algorithms can be developed and maintained by
  independent groups, e.i. by industrial developers and university research
  groups.</p>

  <p>The key components of the Liquid Code framework are constituted by three
  subprojects, that implement the handling of data sources, algorithms and the
  program flow. These components are respectively given by <a href="/pandora"
  title="Pandora">Pandora</a>, <a href="/motley" title="Motley">Motley</a> and
  <a href="/nemoa" title="Nemoa">Nemoa</a>. At their code basis all components
  share a library, given by the <a href="/flib"
  title="Frootlab Shared library">Frootlab Shared Library</a>.</p>

<section>
  <p>We are a young and enthusiastic team of developers and data scientists,
  that has been formed in mid-2018 in Heidelberg, Germany. Some of our
  fundamental convictions are:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc; padding-left: 2rem;">
    <li>Research and education must be free and provided with universal access.
      Accordingly we release our projects as
      <a href="https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/summary.html"
        title="Free Software" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      Free Software</a> that respects it's users freedom and community.
    <li>Public communications services shall not be subject to any control or
      monopoly of single suppliers. For this reason, we regard
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_(information_technology)"
        title="Federation (information technology)"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      federated networking and communication
      </a>as a basic requirement for us and our projects.
    <li>Publicly financed software which is developed for the public sector,
      shall be made publicly available as Free Software. We therefore support
      the <a href="https://publiccode.eu" title="Public Money, Public Code."
