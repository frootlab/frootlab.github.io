  <h3>Vision</h3>
  <p>About our Vision</p>
</header>
<section>
  <p>The prospects about the AI-Revolution can be overwhelming - but although
  the tension is palpable, the accompanied challenges are as well!</p>
  <p>From an individual perspective this concerns enterprises, scientific
  workgroups and government agencies, as it becomes increasingly demanding to
  keep pace with the accelerated development and to stay competitive. On a
  larger scale, the global concentration of data science expertise poses
  the challenge of counteracting new geo-political and economic dependency
  structures that imperil freedoms and sovereignty.</p>
  <p><b>Our vision is a democratic and federated AI-Revolution, that does not
  lead to exclusion or incapacitation, but promotes public well-being, social
  justice and social cohesion.</b></p>

  <p><b>Communication and cooperation are the key factors for scientific and
  industrial progress. Thus we want to best possibly support collaborations in
  data science.</b></p>
  <p>We started with identifying
  <a href="{% post_url 2019-03-20-three-obstacles-in-data-science %}"
    title="Three obstacles in data science and one vision">
    obstacles for collaborations in data science</a>.
  These considerations led to the development of a pioneering software
  framework, that shapes our mission: <a href="/vivid">Vivid Code</a></p>

  {% include site/figure.html url="/images/fig/vivid-code-collaboration.svg"
    description="Collaboration between researchers (green) and developers
    (blue) using the Vivid Code framework" %}

  <p>Vivid Code is a software framework for machine learning and data analysis
  applications, that interconnects collaborative data science with automated
  machine learning. Thereby it separates data sources and algorithms from the
  program flow, which provides some significant advantages for collaboration:
  The program flow and the algorithms can be developed and maintained by
  different expert groups, e.g. by industrial developers and university research
  groups.</p>
  <p>The main components of Vivid Code are constituted by three subprojects,
  which face the individual challenges that accompany data sources, algorithms
  and program flows. These components are respectively given by
  <a href="/projects/deet.html" title="Vivid DB">Vivid DB</a>,
  <a href="/projects/brea.html" title="Vivid Store">Vivid Store</a> and
  <a href="/projects/rian.html" title="Vivid Node">Vivid Node</a>.
  At their code basis all components share a
  <a href="/projects/hup.html" title="Hup">common library</a>.</p>

  <h3>About Us</h3>
  <p>About us and our convictions</p>
</header>
<section>
  <p>We are a young and enthusiastic team of developers and data scientists,
  that has been formed in mid-2018 in Heidelberg, Germany. Some of our
  fundamental convictions are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Research and education must be free and provided with universal access.
      Accordingly we release our projects as
      <a href="https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/summary.html"
        title="free software" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      free software</a> that respects it's users freedom and community.
    <li>Public communications services shall not be subject to any control or
      monopoly of single suppliers. For this reason, we regard
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_(information_technology)"
        title="Federation (information technology)"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      federated networking and communication
      </a>as a basic requirement for us and our projects.
    <li>Publicly financed software which is developed for the public sector,
      shall be made publicly available as free software. We therefore support
      the <a href="https://publiccode.eu" title="Public Money, Public Code."
