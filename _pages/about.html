  <p>The prospects about the AI-Revolution can be overwhelming - but although
  the tension is palpable, the accompanied challenges are as well!</p>

  <p>From an individual perspective this concerns enterprises, scientific
  workgroups and government agencies, as it becomes increasingly demanding to
  keep pace with the accelerated development and to stay competitive. On a
  larger scale, the global centralization of competencies in data science poses
  the challenge of counteracting new geo-political and economic dependency
  structures and thus to preserve freedoms and sovereignty.</p>

  <p><b>Our vision is a democratic and federated AI-Revolution, that does not lead
  to exclusion or incapacitation, but promotes public well-being, social justice
  and social cohesion.</b></p>

  <p>For us communication and cooperation are the key factors and driving force
  behind scientific and industrial progress.
  </p>

  <p>In order to realize our vision, we
  therefore started to identify the foremost
  <a href="{% post_url 2019-03-20-three-obstacles-in-data-science %}">
    obstacles for collaborations in data science
  </a>.
  These considerations led to the foundations of a pioneering software
  framework, that shapes our mission: The <a href="/liquid">Liquid Code</a>
  framework.
  </p>

  <p>The Liquid Code framework is a software framework for machine learning and
  data analysis applications, that interconnects collaborative data science with
  automated machine learning. Thereby it strictly seperates data sources,
  algorithms and the program flow, which provides some significant advantages:
  The program flow and the algorithms can be developed and maintained by
  independent groups, e.i. by industrial developers and university research
  groups.</p>

  {% include article/figure.html url="/images/fig/liquid-collaboration.svg"
    description="Collaboration between researchers (green) and developers
    (blue) in the Liquid Code framework" %}

  <p> The key components of the Liquid Code Framework are constituted by three
  subprojects, that implement the handling of data sources, algorithms and
  program flow. These components are respectively given by <a href="/pandora"
  title="Pandora">Pandora</a>, <a href="/motley" title="Motley">Motley</a> and
  <a href="/nemoa" title="Nemoa">Nemoa</a> and share a common code base, given
  by the <a href="/flib" title="frootlab shared library">frootlab shared
  library</a>.</p>

  <p>We are a young enthusiastic team of developers and data scientists, which
  has been formed in mid-2018 in Heidelberg, Germany.
  Our fundamental conviction is, that research and education should be
  provided with universal access. Accordingly we release our
  projects as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">free
  software</a>. In order to provide stable development, we keep the sovereignty
  about the code as a single vendor.</p>
