## About

The AI-Revolution provides new challenges for developers in the data analysis
segment. This concerns enterprises, scientific workgroups and government
agencies as well, as it becomes more important to continuously and rapidly adapt
new technologies into existing applications. We want to step into this breach by
supporting the development of smart software, which adepts itself to new
technologies!

To that end we provide a [free and
open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) data
analysis framework, which on the basis of
[TensorFlowÂ®](https://www.tensorflow.org/) incorporates machine intelligence and
collaborative data science into the whole software life cycle. The essential
components of the framework comprise: The universal data interface
[Pandora](pandora.html), the smart algorithm repository [Motley](motley.html)
and the data analysis template system [Nemoa](nemoa.html), which abstracts
explicit algorithms to currently best fitting.
