# About

The ongoing trend towards increasingly complex statistical models provides new
challenges for enterprises and scientific workgroups as well. In order to remain
competitive it becomes more important to continuously adapt new technologies,
such that traditional development cycles need to be revised.

We step into this breach by supporting the development of software, that adepts
itself to new technologies! To this end we provide a
[free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) & [open
source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) framework which live
integrates machine intelligence and collaborative data science.

The essential components of this framework comprise: The universal data
interface [Pandora](pandora.html), the smart algorithm repository
[Motley](motley.html) and the data analysis templating system
[Nemoa](nemoa.html), which abstracts explicit algorithms to [currently best
fitting](/tags#CBF).
