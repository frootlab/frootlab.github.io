# About

The ongoing trend towards increasingly complex statistical models challenges
enterprises and scientific workgroups as well. To remain competitive it becomes
more important to venture collaborations. Good preconditions have already been
created by the de facto standard [TensorFlowÂ®](https://www.tensorflow.org).
Beyond this common ground, the data back-ends and algorithms, however, appear in
wild heterogeneity.

[Frootlab](/tags#Frootlab) [Smart Analytics](/tags#Smart%20Analytics) addresses
this issue with a fairly universal data interface
[Pandora](https://github.com/frootlab/pandora) and an auto-evaluating algorithm
catalog [Motley](https://github.com/frootlab/motley). On their basis
[Nemoa](https://github.com/frootlab/nemoa) even goes further, by abstracting
programming to [currently best fitting](/tags#CBF) algorithms rather then
explicit. In this way our Smart Analytics framework allows low maintenance
enterprise analytics applications, that together with their connected catalogs
even get better with age - like wine.
