# About

The artificial intelligence revolution provides new challenges for developers in
the data analysis segment. This concerns enterprises, scientific workgroups and
governments as well, as it becomes more important to continuously adapt new
technologies into existing applications to remain competitive. We want to step
into this breach by supporting the development of smart software, which adepts
itself to new technologies!

To that end we provide a [free](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software)
& [open source](https://opensource.org/docs/definition.php) data analysis
framework, which incorporates machine intelligence and collaborative data
science into the whole software life cycle of data analysis applications. The
essential components of this framework comprise: The universal data interface
[Pandora](pandora.html), the smart algorithm repository [Motley](motley.html)
and the data analysis template system [Nemoa](nemoa.html), which abstracts
explicit algorithms to currently best fitting.
