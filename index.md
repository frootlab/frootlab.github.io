# About


The ongoing trend towards deep structured and increasingly complex statistical models,
is a serious challenge for enterprises and scientific workgroups.
In particular, as the expertise by far is highly specialised and scattered,
it is becoming more important to venture and effectively support collaborations.

For this purpose, good conditions have already been created by a de facto standard,
provided by [TensorFlowÂ®](https://www.tensorflow.org). Thereupon effective collaborations,
however, require an integrated framework that maintains both, data sources and algorithms.
The Frootlab Smart Analytics framework closes this gap by [Nemoa](https://github.com/frootlab/nemoa),
[Pandora](https://github.com/frootlab/pandora) and [Motley](https://github.com/frootlab/motley).
