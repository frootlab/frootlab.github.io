# About

The artificial intelligence revolution provides new challenges for developers in
the data analysis segment. This concerns enterprises, scientific workgroups and
government agencies as well, as it becomes more important to continuously and
rapidly adapt new technologies into existing applications, to remain
competitive. We want to step into this breach by supporting the development of
smart software, which adepts itself to new technologies!

To that end we provide a [free](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software)
& [open source](https://opensource.org/docs/definition.php) data analysis
framework, which on the basis of [TensorFlowÂ®](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
incorporates machine intelligence and collaborative data science into the whole
software life cycle. The essential components of the framework comprise: The
universal data interface [Pandora](pandora.html), the smart algorithm repository
[Motley](motley.html) and the data analysis template system [Nemoa](nemoa.html),
which abstracts explicit algorithms to currently best fitting.
