# About

The ongoing trend towards increasingly complex statistical models challenges
enterprises and scientific workgroups as well. To remain competitive it becomes
more important to venture collaborations. Good preconditions have already been
created by the de facto standard [TensorFlowÂ®](https://www.tensorflow.org).
Beyond this common ground, the data back-ends and algorithms, however, appear in
wild heterogeneity.

[Frootlab](/tags#Frootlab) [Smart Analytics](/tags#Smart%20Analytics) addresses
this issue with a fairly universal data interface [Pandora](pandora.html) and an
auto-evaluating algorithm repository [Motley](motley.html). On their basis
[Nemoa](nemoa.html) even goes further, by abstracting programming to [currently
best fitting](/tags#CBF) algorithms rather then explicit. In this way our Smart
Analytics framework allows low maintenance enterprise analytics applications,
that together with their connected repositories even get better with age - like
wine.
