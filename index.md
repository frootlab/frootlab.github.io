# About


The ongoing trend towards deep structured and increasingly complex statistical models,
is a serious challenge for enterprises and scientific workgroups.
In particular, as the expertise by far is highly specialised,
it is becoming more important to venture collaborations.
For this purpose, good conditions have already been created by the de facto standard
[TensorFlowÂ®](https://www.tensorflow.org). Besides this common language, however,
the data backends and the algorithms, still appear in multifarious diversity.

The [Frootlab](/tags#Frootlab) [Smart Analytics](/tags#Smart%20Analytics) framework
counteracts this circumstance with the universal data interface
[Pandora](https://github.com/frootlab/pandora) and the algorithm catalog
[Motley](https://github.com/frootlab/motley). At this basis
[Nemoa](https://github.com/frootlab/nemoa) even goes a large step beyond,
by raising the abstraction level of programming to a scaffold level,
based on [currently best fitting algorithms](/tags#CBF), rather then concrete algorithms.
This allows the creation of applications, that are not only kept upd-to-date,
bet indeed get better, with their connected algorithm catalogs.
