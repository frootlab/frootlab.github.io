**Vivid Root** (alias Aughra) is a planned directory service for the
[Vivid Code](https://www.frootlab.org/projects/vivid.html) framework. Vivid Root
is responsible to host and deploy information about algorithm categories and
evaluation metrices to [Vivid Stores](https://www.frootlab.org/projects/vivid/store.html).
Thereupon Vivid Root is aimed to provide information about public Vivid Stores, to allow an
automatic configuration of [Vivid Nodes](https://www.frootlab.org/projects/vivid/node.html).
