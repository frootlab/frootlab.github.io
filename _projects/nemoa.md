**Nemoa** is a machine learning and data analysis framework with rapid
prototyping and cloud assisted building and deployment. Thereby individual
code blocks are automatically retrieved from collaborative algorithm
repositories, that provide the currently best fitting solutions for individual
tasks.

Nemoa is based on the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and
actively developed as part of the [Liquid Code](/liquid) framework.

The key goal of nemoa is to provide a long-term data analysis framework, which
seemingly integrates into existing enterprise data environments and thereby
supports collaborative data science. To achieve this goal nemoa orchestrates
established Python frameworks like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
and [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and dynamically extends their
capabilities by community driven algorithms (e.g. for [probabilistic graphical
modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model), [machine
learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and [structured
data-analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_data_analysis_(statistics))).
