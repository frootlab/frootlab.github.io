**Liquid Code** is a pioneering software framework for next generation data
analysis applications, that interconnects collaborative data science with
automated machine learning.

  description="Cloud-Assisted Meta programming in the Liquid Code framework" %}

Based on the **Cloud-Assisted Meta programming** (CAMP) paradigm, the framework
allows the usage of **Currently Best Fitting** (CBF) algorithms. Before code
interpretation / compilation the concrete algorithms, that implement the CBF
specifications, are automatically chosen from local and public catalog servers,
that host and deploy the concrete algorithms. Thereby the specification is
constituted by a unique algorithm category, a data domain and a metric, which
substantiates the meaning of *Best Fitting* within the respective algorithm- and
data context. An example is the average prediction accuracy within a fixed set
of gold standard samples of the data domain (e.g. latin handwriting samples,
spoken word samples, TCGA gene expression data, etc.).

The Liquid Code framework allows the implementation of cutting edge enterprise
analytical applications, that are automatically kept up-to-date and therefore
**minimize their maintenance costs**. Also the Liquid Code framework facilitates
the publication, application, sharing and comparison of algorithms, within and
between workgroups.
