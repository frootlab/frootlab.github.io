**Vivid Code** is a pioneering software framework for next generation data
analysis applications, that interconnects collaborative data science with
automated machine learning.

The Vivid Code framework implements a new programming paradigm, that shapes it's
design: **Cloud-Assisted Meta programming**. The rough idea behind this paradigm
is to replace frequently used code elements by best practices, that are
hosted within a federated cloud. Whereas the development and advance of these
code elements is subject to collaborative achievements, their evaluation is
automatically performed by using machine intelligence. This provides significant
advantages, in particular for data science:

* The dynamic replacement of code elements by **Currently Best Fitting**
  algorithms automatically keeps projects state-of-the-art while reducing their
  TCO
* The separation of program flow and algorithms allows them to be developed and
  maintained by different expert groups
* The interconnection of algorithm servers to self maintained clusters allows
  collaborations in data science at an entirely new level.

### How does it work?

Before code interpretation at [Vivid Nodes](/projects/rian.html), the currently
best fitting algorithms are requested from connected [Vivid
Stores](/projects/brea.html). Thereby any node may be connected to one or many
stores and stores may be interconnected to self maintained clusters. In order to
share and automatically evaluate the algorithms, the stores as well as the nodes
use a universal data mapper, given by [Vivid DB](/projects/brea.html). This
allows collaborating organizations to share or to offer algorithms without the
need to share data! Together these three components constitute the Vivid Code
framework.
