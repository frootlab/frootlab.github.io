**Vivid Node** is a <a href="https://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python</a>
based machine learning and data analysis framework with rapid prototyping and
cloud assisted building and deployment. Thereby individual code blocks are
automatically retrieved from collaborative algorithm repositories, that provide
the currently best fitting solutions for individual tasks.

The key goal of Vivid Node is to provide a long-term data analysis framework,
which seemingly integrates into existing enterprise data environments and
thereby supports collaborative data science. To achieve this goal Vivid Node
orchestrates established frameworks like <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org"
target="_blank">TensorFlow</a> and dynamically extends their capabilities
by community driven algorithms (e.g. for probabilistic graphical modeling,
machine learning and structured data-analysis).
