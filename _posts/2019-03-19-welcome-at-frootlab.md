**We are a young developers team with strong expertise in data science and
networking technologies. Our vision is to realize the full potential of
artificial intelligence for scientific and industrial progress and always based
on ethical principles.**

For us communication and cooperation are the key factors and driving force
beyond scientific and industrial progress. In order to realize our vision, we
therefore used our personal experiences to identify today's foremost challenges
in data science and started to develop comprehensive [solutions]({% post_url
2019-03-20-three-obstacles-in-data-science %}), based on an entirely new
[programming paradigm](/blog/tags#CAMP).

According to our fundamental convictions we release our products as [free and
open-source
software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) to
provide universal access to research and education. Since the application of our
products in industrial environments requires stable development and compliance
with industrial standards, it is important to us to maintain the developmental
sovereignty. For this reason we release our products as single vendor
open-source projects rather then community-driven.
