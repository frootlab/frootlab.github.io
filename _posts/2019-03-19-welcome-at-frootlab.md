**We are a young developers team with strong expertise in data science and
networking technologies. Our vision is a democratic and federated AI-Revolution,
that does not lead to exclusion or incapacitation, but promotes public
well-being, social justice and social cohesion.**

For us communication and cooperation are the key factors and driving force
behind scientific and industrial progress. In order to realize our vision, we
therefore started to identify [the foremost obstacles for collaborations in data
science]({% post_url 2019-03-20-three-obstacles-in-data-science %}) and started
to develop comprehensive [solutions, based on an entirely new [programming
paradigm](/blog/tags#CAMP).

According to our fundamental convictions we release our products as [free
software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software){:target='_blank'}
to provide universal access to research and education. Since the application of
our projects in industrial environments requires stable development and
compliance with industrial standards, it currently is important to us to
maintain the developmental sovereignty, for which we release our products as
single vendor open-source projects rather then community-driven.
