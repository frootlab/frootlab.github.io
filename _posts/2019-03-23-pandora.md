**Online analytical processing and predictive analytics in combination with
machine learning provides a new challenge in data-warehousing: The response time
for large transactions of data from different domains.**

Today's data analysis and enterprise analytical applications, increasingly
utilize complex statistical models, like artificial neural networks, which
demand large amounts of raw unaggregated data. Since for many of such
applications, however, the response time is critical, it is becoming quite
clear, that the traditional approach, to dump day-to-day data into a huge
repository for data analysis, needs to be revised.

So how to create a high throughput data transaction structure with low latency?
Of course, the key is decentralization! The simple idea is to directly "plug"
the analysis applications into the source data systems they require. On a closer
perspective, however, this idea turns out to be horrible! It not only spawns an
absolutely unmanageable jumble of data interfaces (which first of all have to be
implemented), but also does not provide any flexibility to the underlying
structure. ... Nevertheless - At no time people have been deterred of any simple
idea by the argument of "a bad idea"! The result is, where we find ourselves
today: In a Plug Jumble!

## What is Pandora?

**In order to bring a little more order into the chaos, we have decided not to
follow the most simple idea, but that one right after it: A multi plug!**

[Pandora](/pandora.html) is a universal data interface and SQL-Database engine,
that mediates between data source systems (like operational databases) and data
analysis applications. To this end Pandora implements the two fundamental layers
of a data warehouse.

The **integration layer** of Pandora is implemented by a modular plugin-system,
which allows it to stay light-weight, while flexibly supporting a wide variety
of different data sources. The included data support comprises an SQL-plugin,
which utilizes [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org) to allow it\'s
connection to a variety of SQL-Databases ([IBM
Db2](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/db2/), [Oracle
Database](https://www.oracle.com/database/), [SAP
HANA](https://www.sap.com/products/hana.html), [Microsoft
SQL](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com),
[Postgesql](https://www.postgresql.org/), ...). There above Pandora as aimed to
ship with integrated support for the most common laboratory measurement devices,
flat files and data generators that appear in the wild.

The **staging layer** of Pandora is currently implemented as a native
SQL-Database engine, featuring a DB-API 2.0 interface with full SQL:2016
support, a vertical data storage manager and real-time encryption. On this
foundation Pandora is aimed to support sampling in common data analysis formats:
[NumPy-Arrays](http://www.numpy.org/) and
[R-Tables](https://www.r-project.org/).

According to our [convictions](/corporate/2019/03/19/welcome-at-frootlab.html),
Pandora is [free and
open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), based
on the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and actively
developed as part of our [Liquid ML](https://github.com/orgs/frootlab/projects)
framework. For more information please visit
