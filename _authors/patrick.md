I'm a passionate mathematician, obsessive software developer and convinced
enthusiast! As a mathematician my special vice is the connection of statistics
with differential geometry to create a [new branch of
statistics](/blog/tags#structural statistics) that serves as the foundation for
structured data analysis, like [deep learning](/blog/tags#Deep Learning). As a
developer I'm propelled by [AutoML]({{ site.url }}/blog/tags#AutoML) and
[CAMP](/blog/tags#CAMP). My attitude and interests are firmly shaped by my
highly appreciated former mentors [Willy
JÃ¤ger](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willi_J%C3%A4ger) and [Karlheinz
Meier](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlheinz_Meier).
