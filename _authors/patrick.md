I'm a passionate mathematician, obsessive software developer and convinced
enthusiast! As a mathematician my special vice is the connection of statistics
with differential geometry to create a new branch of statistics that serves as
the foundation for structured data analysis, like **deep learning**. As a
developer I'm propelled by **AutoML** and **cloud-assisted meta programming**.
My attitude and interests are firmly shaped by my highly appreciated former
mentors [Willy JÃ¤ger](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willi_J%C3%A4ger){:target='_blank'}
and [Karlheinz Meier](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlheinz_Meier){:target='_blank'}.
