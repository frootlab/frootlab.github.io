Before everything else I'm a hopeless enthusiast! As a mathematician my special
vice is the fusion of statistics, differential geometry and topology to
[structural statistics](/tags#structural statistics). As a developer I totally
fell in love with [Cloud-Assisted Meta Programming](/tags#CAMP). My way of
thinking is strongly influenced by my former mentors [Willy
JÃ¤ger](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willi_J%C3%A4ger) and [Karlheinz
Meier](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlheinz_Meier).
