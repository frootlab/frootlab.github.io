Above everything else I'm a hopeless enthusiast! As a mathematician my special
vice is the fusion of statistics, functional analysis and differential geometry
to [structural statistics](/tags#structural statistics). Read my posts: I bet
You will be amazed! As a software architect I'm driven by the [Cloud-Assisted
Meta Programming](/tags#CAMP) paradigm.
