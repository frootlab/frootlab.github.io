Passionate mathematician, obsessive software developer and convinced enthusiast!
As a mathematician my special vice is the connection of statistics with
differential geometry to create a [new branch of statistics](/tags#structural
statistics) that serves as the foundation for structured data analysis, like
deep learning. As a developer I'm propelled by [AutoML](/tags#AutoML) and
[CAMP](/tags#CAMP). My attitude and interests are firmly shaped by my highly
appreciated former mentors [Willy
JÃ¤ger](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willi_J%C3%A4ger) and [Karlheinz
Meier](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlheinz_Meier).
